/*
 * Write a Java program that reads the file "files/weather.data"
 * The program must read the file line by line
 * The program parses each line that it reads
 * For example, for this line: 
 * 19.7|11|1/3/1995
 * The first value is temperature
 * The second value is humidity
 * The last value is the date, composed of day, month, and year 
 * The program must 
 * 1- print each line as the following string:
 *    {"Temperature" = 19.7, "Humidity" = 11, "day"=1, "month" = 3, "year"=1995}
 * 2- Add all temperature values in an ArrayList temperatureList
 * 3- Add all humidity values in an ArrayList humidityList
 * 4- Prints the average temperature as: Average Temperature = avg_temperature_value
 * 5- Prints the average humidity as: Average Hmudidity = avg_humidity_value
 * Save the average value of temperature and humidity in a file with name "statistics.txt" in the form
 * year:temperature average:hmudity average
